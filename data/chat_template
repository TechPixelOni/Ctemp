Pre-authorization Script:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"What you would likely be seeing is the pre-authorization hold. For this, we have to request from your financial institution to hold the funds until the item is shipped. Based on their policy, this hold would fall off your account typcially within 3 - 5 business days, but their policy could be different from most banks. I would advise asking about pre-authorization with your institution for more clarification on when this hold falls off your account if you are seeing two charges at once."

Returns information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Your shipment will be picked up the same manner it was delivered (e.g., boxed, curbside, threshold, white-glove). The freight carrier will contact you within the next 5-7 business days to schedule the pickup appointment. You'll receive an email with more information from costco_ops@operations.costco.com."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"This will take about 2 - 3 business days for this to be refunded."
